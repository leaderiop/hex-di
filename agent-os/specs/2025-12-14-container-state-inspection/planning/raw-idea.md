# Container State Inspection - Raw Idea

**Feature Name:** Container State Inspection

**Roadmap Item:** #18

**Description:** Implement runtime inspection utilities to view resolved services, instance lifetimes, and scope hierarchy for the hex-di dependency injection library.

This feature should enable developers to inspect:
- What services have been resolved in a container
- The lifetime of each resolved service (singleton, scoped, request)
- The scope hierarchy (parent-child relationships between containers/scopes)
